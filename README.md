A lightweight, experimental Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) optimistic rollup implementation built from scratch.

⚠️ **WARNING: Not for Production Use**
I implemented this just for learning and experimentation It is not secure or complete enough for production environments.

## Overview

This is a minimalist EVM optimistic rollup implementation.

### Features

- Basic EVM opcode execution
- Simple state management
- Local execution environment
- Minimal dependencies

### Limitations

- Not optimized for performance
- Missing many security features
- Incomplete implementation of EVM specifications
- No network functionality
- Limited testing coverage

## Getting Started

Just npm install it's not hard to figure out come on

## Once again, just for educational Purpose

- Learning about EVM internals
- Experimenting with smart contract execution
- Understanding blockchain virtual machines
- Educational demonstrations

Feel free to pull, shit on it or something but I'm not working on it no more :)
